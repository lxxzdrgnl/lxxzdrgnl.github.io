Hello, I'm Yongjae Lee, a developer who turns curiosity into action. When I have an idea, I don't hesitate to try it out myself, and I enjoy learning new technologies, solving problems, and growing in the process.

This spirit of inquiry has led to various project experiences. Based on my interest in the recently spotlighted voice AI technology, I have experience in producing voice conversion content by directly training the RVC model, and releasing it on YouTube through video editing, recording a high number of 500,000 views. This was an experience that showed my ability to quickly acquire new technologies and create content that draws public interest.

In addition, to build a solid foundation for web development, I created a bulletin board that implements Google authentication through backend development using Spring Boot, and I can build a simple frontend UI using not only HTML/CSS/JavaScript but also Vue.js.

I am very interested in applying new technologies like AI to actual services, and I aim to become a full-stack developer who creates attractive user experiences on a stable backend foundation. Based on my experience across various fields and my fast learning ability, I will become a developer who creatively solves any problem.
